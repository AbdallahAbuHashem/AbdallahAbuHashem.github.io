        <p class="intro">This is a story of a society where people have an issue with fake news. Through this story we illustrate the danger of fake news, and its effect on creating echo chambers.</p>

            <p>However, one of the articles that catches his eye is fake. The fake news is in favor of the democrats.</p>

            <p>Green is a naive member of the society. They not know whether to believe it or not.</p>

            <p>Green's shared piece of news gets circulated few times, and spreads among many different people.</p>

            <p>Democrats like the news that they got from Green, and keep sharing it among them.</p>

          <div class='step1' data-step='9'>
            <p>Republicans do not like, and as a result they stop sharing it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step1' data-step='10'>
            <p>This leads to the spread of fake news that agree with each group between that group. The inter-connections within the group will get stronger, while the connections with the opposing party will weaken. Echo chambers will be created.</p>

        <h3>What affects what people believe?</h3>
        <p class="intro">
          A study conducted by a Stanford professor have looked at different potential factors that might determine whether people believe or do not believe fake news. Below we take a look at the strongest factor that was found in the study.
        </p>

      <section id='scroll'>
        <div class='scroll__graphic' id="graphic">
          <div class='chartScroll' id='chartScroll'>
            <div class="chart"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='scroll__text'>
          <div class='step' data-step='1'>
            <p>The study have found a strong correlation between alignment of fake news with personal political views and believing fake news. It found that democrats are 17.2% more likely to believe pro-Clinton fake news, and republicans are 14.7% more likely to believe pro-Trump fake news. The study have looked at other factors like age and education, and none of them had as strong correlation as political alignment.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step' data-step='2'>
            <p>Assuming that people are only going to share news when they believe it, we will get the vicious cycle shown to the right. People agreeing with news is going to lead them to believing it, so they will share it. If they share it with others who have same political view, the cylce will continue by another person. If it was shared with someone who does not hold same political views, they will be less likely to believe and share it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step' data-step='3'>
            <p>
              Given that people are more likely to believe fake news that aligns with their political views, the sources (including friends) that share these news are more likely to be labeled as trustworthy by the viewer. On the other hand, the sources which does not share political views will be labeled as fake. The viewer will want to read from the trustworthy sources as much as possible, and will try to avoid the other sources. This creates echo chambers that are based on political views.

        <h3>My Chamber, My News</h3>
        <p class="intro">Although the data presented thus far deal with fake news and its relation to political views, believing news based on political views have dangerous consequences on factual news. As news validity becomes based on political alignment, we fear that this will lead to delegimization of factual news. In fact, the graph below shows the decline in people's trust in mainstream media over the last 19 years. (1997 - 2016 excluding 2006). <b>The blue is for democrats, purple is the overall and red is for republicans.</b></p>

            <h4>More on News Delegitmization</h4>
              <p>
                With the decline in trust in mainstream media, viewers will seek other ways to get news. One possible outlet is social media. Since social media platforms like Facebook cater to what viewers want, users will get news that they agree with regardless of its factuality. As people consume more fake news, this will make all news look wimilar regardless of its factuality, which hurts factual news legitmiacy. <br/>
                Another thing that delegitmizes the factual news even more is the blur between the actual definition of fake news and the mis-labeling of fake news on purpose. Fake news is supposed to mean that the news is not factual. Now, we have people like Donald Trump who's definition of fake news is along the lines of "I take offense with what you said" even when the news is factual.

        <h3>Closing the Loop</h3>
        <p class="intro">
          As mentioned above, news could lose its legitimacy by people relying on their personal circles for news rather than mainstream media. Since social media is built on preferability, people will read more fake news that aligns with their view, and will grow their network in a way that aligns with their political view. This will reinforce the existence of echo chambers, which closes the loop from echo chambers to delegitmization of the media and back to echo chambers as shown below.
