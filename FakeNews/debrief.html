        <h3>Fake News on The Social Network</h3>
        <p class="intro">This is a story of a society where people have an issue with fake news. Through this story we illustrate the danger of fake news, and its effect on creating echo chambers.</p>

        <div class='scroll__text1'>
          <div class='step1' data-step='1'>
            <p>People in our society are split into republicans, democrats and neutral. All people are wonderful and equal in this society.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step1' data-step='2'>
            <p>We start off by introducing Green, a neutral character in the society</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step1' data-step='3'>
            <p>Green decides to read the news.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step1' data-step='4'>
            <p>However, one of the articles that catches his eye is fake. The fake news is in favor of the democrats. Green has no way of checking the news.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step1' data-step='5'>
            <p>So Green does not know whether to believe it or not.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step1' data-step='6'>
            <p>Regardless, they decide to share it with their friends on the social media.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step1' data-step='7'>
            <p>Initially, all of Green's friends decide to share the news causing it to spread.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step1' data-step='8'>
            <p>Democrats like the news that they got from Green, and keep sharing it among them.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step1' data-step='9'>
            <p>Republicans do not like, and as a result they stop sharing it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step1' data-step='10'>
            <p>This leads to the spread of fake news that agree with each group between that group. The inter-connections within the group will get stronger, while the connections with the opposing party will weaken. Echo chambers will be created.</p>

            <h3>Fake News: If only People Knew...</h3>
            <p class="intro">It is quite common (and natural) to think that people share fake news out of ignorance, or that they do believe in what they share. However, multiple studies have shown that the majority of people are well-informed, and can recognize fake news. What is the issue then? Here, we visualize the data from a study that was done arounf the 2016 elections and fake news. The study then leads us to conclusions about why fake news is so prominent nowadays, and what are the effects.</p>

        <h3>Fake News: If only People Knew...</h3>
        <p class="intro">It is quite common (and natural) to think that people share fake news out of ignorance, or that they do believe in what they share. However, multiple studies have shown that the majority of people are well-informed, and can recognize fake news. What is the issue then? A study conducted by a Stanford professor have looked at other factors that might determine whether people believe or do not believe fake news.</p>

      <section id='scroll'>
        <div class='scroll__graphic' id="graphic">
          <div class='chartScroll' id='chartScroll'>

        <div class='scroll__text'>
          <div class='step' data-step='1'>
            <p>The study have found a strong correlation between alignment of fake news with personal political views and believing fake news. It found that democrats are 17.2% more likely to believe pro-Clinton fake news, and republicans are 14.7% more likely to believe pro-Trump fake news. The study have looked at other factors like age and education, and none of them had as strong correlation as political alignment.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step' data-step='2'>
            <p>Assuming that people are only going to share news when they believe it, we will get the vicious cycle shown to the right. People agreeing with news is going to lead them to believing it, so they will share it. If they share it with others who have same political view, the cylce will continue by another person. If it was shared with someone who does not hold same political views, they will be less likely to believe and share it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step' data-step='3'>
            <p>
              Given that people are more likely to believe fake news that aligns with their political views, the sources (including friends) that share these news are more likely to be labeled as trustworthy by the viewer. On the other hand, the sources which does not share political views will be labeled as fake. The viewer will want to read from the trustworthy sources as much as possible, and will try to avoid the other sources. This creates echo chambers that are based on political views.

        <h3>My Chamber, My News</h3>
        <p class="intro">Although the data presented thus far deal with fake news and its relation to partisanship, believing news based on political views and the echo chambers it creates have dangerous consequences on real media. As news validity becomes based on political alignment, we fear that this will lead to media delgitmization. In fact, the graph below shows the decline in people's trust in media over the last 19 years. (1997 - 2016 excluding 2006)</p>

            <h4>More on Media Delegitmization</h4>
              <p>
                Another thing that helps more with the delegitmization of the media is the blur between the actual definition of fake news and how we see current "fake news". Fake news is supposed to mean that the news is not factual. Now, we have people like Donald Trump who's definition of fake news is along the lines of "I take offense with what you said". By using this definition, Trump has become a clear example of the dangerous effect of basing news' validity on agreeing with it.

        <h3>Closing the Loop</h3>
        <p class="intro">
          Media delegitmization will push people to seek other sources for news other than traditional media since it is no longer trusted. One of these possible alternatives is social media. Since social media is built on preferability, it will lead back to more and more creation of echo chambers, which closes the loop from echo chambers to delegitmization of the media and back to echo chambers as shown below.
